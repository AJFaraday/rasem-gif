RASEM animation
---------------

This is a quick look at producing SVG based gif animation using the rasem gem.

All instructions are for use in linux, MAC instructions may vary. (Best guess is that you just can't in windows)

Before you start:

* sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems imagemagick
* sudo gem install rasem
* git clone git@github.com:AJFaraday/rasem-gif.git

From within a sub-folder of rasem-gif:

* ruby make\_gif.rb
* Open resutl.gif and enjoy
